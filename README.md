# modeldb-notebooks

Set of notebooks for testing modeldb.

**NOTE**: The notebooks depend on [SparkMLUtils](https://github.com/hariharsubramanyam/SparkMLUtils).
So make sure to clone the repo, build the JAR, and add it as a Spark interpreter dependency in 
[Apache Zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/).
